Introduction
Traditional HVAC systems rely on physics-based methodologies like Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, which often lead to inefficiencies. This project leverages IoT sensors to gather continuous data and applies machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and optimize system performance.

Features
Continuous monitoring of temperature, airflow, and humidity
Anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms
Improved energy efficiency and system reliability
Data visualization for better insights
Dataset
The project uses data collected from various IoT sensors installed in HVAC systems. The sensors gather continuous data on temperature, airflow, and humidity, which is then used for analysis and model training.

Algorithms Used
Linear Regression: Used for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Applied for classification and regression tasks.
Data Visualization Techniques: Employed for better insights and interpretation of the data.
Results
The implemented model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 0.051 for SVMs, significantly improving HVAC system efficiency and reliability.
